# EVM Metering analysis

This repository contains the code to reproduce the analysis conducted in the EVM gas metering project. The project aims to understand how gas metering rules impact block throughput and utilization in Ethereum.

The folder `notebooks` contains the data analysis, while the folder `src` contains the data pipeline and simulation code.

Please refer to our [documentation](https://hackmd.io/@nightingale/evm-gas-meter) for more information on the project and the key results.

This project was supported by a grant from the Ethereum Foundation, namely \[ROP-15\] EVM gas metering - Empirical analysis.
